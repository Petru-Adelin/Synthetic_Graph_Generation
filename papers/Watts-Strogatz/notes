From the paper provided by the teacher:

!!!! Random graph generator that creates a G with small-world properties;
!! Look up what small-world properties are !!

small-world properties are 2:   1) average path length
				2) high clusering coefficients


the underlying structure: 

	*) A lattice structure -> produce a locally clustered network 
	*) random links on this structure produces
