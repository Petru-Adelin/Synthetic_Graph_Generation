From the file provided by the teacher:

1) ER model is of two types: 
	Frist One: *)  choose a graph from all the possible graphs with N(nodes) and V(verteces) !! choose with a uniform distribution probability !!
		   *)  
	

	Second One: *) Nodes are created by connecting random nodes witha probability 'p' -> if (p increases ): generate Graphs with more edges
		    *) More used in practice
		    *) can reproduce Graphs where the Node-Degree distribution follows a poisson distribution


???? What are heavy tails ???? The model has been criticized because doesn't have many of these as the real world graphs



From the geeks for geeks:

* The first type model is just a random choice of a Graph G(N, V) where the N, V are determined.
	ex: for G(3, 2) we have 3 options with a uniform distribution => p = 1/3  => select with p from the 3 posibilities

* For the second model we start with: 
	1) N isolated nodes 
	2) for each pair of nodes a edge is added with probability p(the probability is independent of any other addition) 
	3) based on 2) we have comb(n, 2) possible edges with p(independent) => each edge is added as a follow from a Bernoulli trial of probability p 
	4) The expected value of the number_of_edges = comb(n, 2) * p (multiplication allowed due to independance)    !!! number_of_edges - is a Random Variable(RV) !!!

	
	About the probability p:
	!) p is given(fixed input to the model = likelyhood of an edge to be present)
	!) chosen by the desired density density or expected average degree of the graphs
	!) for a node - given that to have a +1 degree the probability is p - then the degree distribution is a Binomial Distribution( where the maxim degree is n-1 )
	!) for large N and small p such that N*p = y => The Binomial Distribution aproximates to the Poisson(of param y) distribution -----> !!!!! WORTH LOOKING INTO THIS APROXIMATION TOPIC
	!) p in the lenses of above ideea can be set to n/y in large graphs to achieve a target average degree 

	!!!!) The probability of generating a specific graph G with |E| edges: p^|E| * (1-p)^(comb(n, 2) - |E|) -> Binomial probability 


	
* Properties that may help me in any way:
	1) as the p increase I can expect to get graphs with many more edges
	2) A graph generated by the ER has on average comb(n, 2)*p edges
	3) for n -> infinity and np = constant we approach with the P(deg(v) = k) = [n * p^k * e^(-n*p)] / k! ~~ Poisson(n, k)
	4) ln n/n is a sharp threshold for the connectedness of the generated Graph -> regard the photo in this folder on the behaviour


! Important for the section from geeks to geeks is to remember what a Clique and A Dual Graph is:
!) Clique --> is the subset of a graph, that determines a complete graph here 2 terms are useful: 1) Maximum Clique -> the Clique with the most verteces
												  2) clique number for a graph -> size of the maximum Clique of a graph

!) Dual Graph --> is a graph representation of the connection of the regions of a planar graph
		  We consider a planar graph and construct a graph by considering the verteces as region representation and for each 2 neighbour regions we connect the related nodes
